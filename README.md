# Deep Q Network RL Agent

This repository is based off of (https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl).

New exploration and exploitation strategies have been implemented on top of the base code.

## Run the Code

The example files detail how to set up and run a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning with a convolutional neural network for processing the raw pixels from ATARI games. 

## Dependencies

+ Tensorflow
+ Open AI Gym
+ Keras 

The above packages require additional dependencies, see their documentation for more information.
